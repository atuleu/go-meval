go-meval
========

A mathematical expression  parser / evaluator in go.


It uses simply the shutting yard algorithm to parse a mathemical expression in an AST.

This AST can then be evaluated within a context, letting user define a dictionnary of expression that can refer other expression. It is not designed to be fast, but only to provide an easy way to mathematically parametrize your program at a configuration level.
